The "helmet detection from image" project aims to detect the presence of helmets in images using the YOLOv7 model, which is a state-of-the-art deep learning algorithm for object detection. The project involves the following steps:

Data collection: Images of people wearing helmets and people without helmets need to be collected to train the YOLOv7 model. The dataset should be large and diverse enough to ensure that the model can detect helmets accurately under different lighting conditions, angles, and backgrounds.

Data labeling: The images need to be labeled with bounding boxes around the helmets to train the model. This labeling process can be done manually or using an automated tool.

Model training: The YOLOv7 model needs to be trained on the labeled dataset using a deep learning framework such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The model is trained to learn the features of helmets and detect them accurately in images.

Model testing: Once the model is trained, it needs to be tested on a separate dataset of images to evaluate its accuracy and performance. The testing dataset should contain images that are different from the training dataset to ensure that the model can generalize well.

Overall, the project aims to improve safety by detecting whether people are wearing helmets in images, which can be useful in applications such as sports, construction, and transportation.
